# M2files

These are my calculations and output files in Macaulay2 for my PhD. They are intended for personal use only. However, if you find them useful, please use my code freely.

## What I'm calculating

This will be explained in my thesis when it is done, but here's a few buzzwords: I'm studying Calabi-Yau manifolds, and I have found a particular one. I study its symmetries, its deformations and degenerations. 

## Macaulay2

Macaulay2 is a computer algebra system for computations in commutative algebra. Please check the [official website](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/). 


## List of files

1. `Z2_invariant_subspaces.m2` Tried to compute invariant subspaces in Grassmannian. Too complicated.
2. `altmannartikkel.m2` Computations on some examples in Klaus Altmann's article "The
versal Deformation of an isolated toric Gorenstein Singularity".
3. `cdp6_pfaffian.m2` Realized that C(dP6) can be realized as a simple pfaffian.
4. `annenTriangUtregning.m2` Here I study a group action on X_0. It turns out that it admits a group action by Z_2^3, but with quite a lot of isolated singularities. I also calculate the coordinates of the singularities of a special CI in the 5-dimensional toric Y.
