\frametitle{Hodge numbers}

The quintic $X = V(f) \subset \P^4$ is the canonical example of a \CY. It has Hodge numbers $h^{11}=1$ and $h^{12}=101$.

\begin{remark}[Heuristic]
    The number $h^{12}$ is the dimension of the ``space of parameters'' of $X$. The following heuristic will give us the correct Hodge number:
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item
	    The space of degree $5$ polynomials $H^0\big(\P^4, \OO_{\P^4}(5)\big)$ in $\P^4$ is $\binom{4 + 5}{5} = \binom{9}{4} = 126$-dimensional. Hence $\P\big(H^0\big(\P^4, \OO_{\P^4}(5)\big)\big) = \P^{125}$.

	    \item
	    This is not unique, but we can act by $\PGL(5)$ to identify isomorphic quintics. We have $\dim \PGL(5)=25-1=24$.

	    \item
	    In total: $125 - 24 = 101$, which is $h^{12}(X)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
