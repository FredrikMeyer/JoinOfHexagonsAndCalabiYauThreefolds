# Outline PhD presentation (~1 hour)

 1. Short outline of what I did, and did not. Mention the unsucessfull attempt to produce hyper-Kähler varieties. The smoothing components of `C(dP6)`. The construction of new Calabi-Yau varieties. (~7 min)
 2. Rest of talk: Introduce Stanley-Reisner schemes. Motivate Calabi-Yau varieties and explain my construction. (~ 15 min)
 3. Explain SR-schemes. One-dimensional examples. Explain the SR-ideal of the hexagon. (~ 10 min)
 3. Introduce Calabi-Yau manifolds. Explain that smoothing of spheres are CY's. (~ 10 min)
 4. Mention mirror symmetry (strange duality between different CY manifolds. Lots of theory -> duality of derived categories). Explain orbifolding and Roan's formula (<- very constructive). (~ 10 min)
 5. Motivate my construction: comes from the two embeddings of `dP6 -> P^6` and `dP6 -> P^7`. (~ 10 min)
 6. Explain construction. Explain calculation of Euler characteristic, and also heuristic for Hodge numbers. (~ 15 min)
 7. Explain orbifold construction. (~ 10 min)

Sum tid: 87 min (for mye!)
