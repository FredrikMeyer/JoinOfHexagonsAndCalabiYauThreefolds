# Joins of hexagons and Calabi-Yau threefolds

This is the source code of my thesis for the degree of Philosophiae Doctor. The PDF file is [here](thesis/main.pdf).

## Abstract

The main goal of my thesis is the construction of new Calabi-Yau manifolds. I study the singularity `C(dP_6)`, which is the cone over a del Pezzo surface of degree 6. It has two topologically distinct smoothings. In Chapter 3, I compute the the singular homology groups of each smoothing.

The last chapter is devoted to the construction of new Calabi-Yau manifolds. I also propose mirror candidates.

## The structure of this repository

The folder "thesis" contains the LaTeX source of my thesis. The folder "calculations" contains the source code of my `Macaulay2` calculations.
